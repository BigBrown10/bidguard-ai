# WINNING STRATEGIES FOR GOVERNMENT TENDERS (UK)

## 1. THE "WIN THEME" PRINCIPLE
*   **Don't just answer the question.** Every answer must explicitly link back to a "Win Theme" (e.g., Innovation, Risk Reduction, Social Value).
*   **The "So What?" Test**: After every technical claim, ask "So what?". If the answer isn't "It saves the client money/time/risk", delete it.

## 2. SOCIAL VALUE IS NOT AN ADD-ON
*   Social Value is now 10-20% of the score.
*   **Specifics Win**: Don't say "We support local jobs." Say "We will hire 3 apprentices from postal code [X] for 24 months."
*   **Green Plans**: Must address Carbon Reduction Plan (PPN 06/21).

## 3. EVIDENCE OVER ASSERTION
*   **Weak**: "We have extensive experience."
*   **Strong**: "We have delivered [X] projects of similar scale for [Client Y], achieving [Z]% efficiency gains."
*   **Golden Rule**: Claim + Evidence + Outcome.

## 4. CLINICAL WRITING STYLE
*   **Active Voice**: "We will implement..." NOT "It will be implemented..."
*   **Structure**: Use headings, bullet points, and bold text to make it skimmable for evaluators who are reading 50 proposals.
*   **Mirroring**: Use the client's exact terminology. If they say "Service User", do not say "Customer".

## 5. RISK MANAGEMENT
*   Evaluators are risk-averse. 
*   Explicitly mention your "Risk Register" and "Business Continuity Plan".
*   Show you have thought about what could go wrong and have a mitigation ready.
